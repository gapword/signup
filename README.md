Hello, this is one of my few little projects i work on. I made this sign-up/sign-in page just to understand a little bit more about HTML and CSS (no other script kinds were used).
I had to watch a tutorial as i am new to coding and am just learning.
If there is any error please tell me and i will either fix it/help you.
You are free to download the login folder which contains all the files needed for the sign-up/sign-in page.
If you want to you can make it a FULL website from that sign-up/sign-in page which i made from scratch.
All the required files are in the folder.
Enjoy!
